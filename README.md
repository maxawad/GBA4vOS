GBA4vOS is a native visionOS app that allows you to relive your favorite Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games and place them wherever you'd like in the world! GBA4vOS is the spiritual successor to [GBA4iOS](http://www.gba4iosapp.com) — a Game Boy Advance emulator for iOS devices [Paul Thorsen](https://twitter.com/pau1thor) and I made while in high school together.

## Licensing
Due to the licensing of emulator cores used by GBA4vOS, I have no choice but to distribute GBA4vOS under the **AGPLv3 license**. That being said, I explicitly give permission for anyone to use, modify, and distribute all *my* original code for this project in any form, with or without attribution, without fear of legal consequences (dependencies remain under their original licenses, however).
